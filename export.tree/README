Visual Working Memory.  Mostly unpublished!   Beh data published here:  10.3758/s13415-018-0584-6.   EEG data never published.   Same sample as this published study: 10.1038/ncomms6394.  30 healthy participants (3 dropout) in a double-blind drug study.    Total n=27.   Drug was Cabergoline 1.25 mg.   Subjects had IDs 305/405 - 330/430.   The dual numbers were for session:  300s were first session, 400s were second session.  Here we have simply put them in as session 1 and session 2.   So Joe Smith would have been 305 on visit 1, then 405 on visit 2.  If he got cab first we indicated that in the Sess1_Drug column.   Task included in Matlab programming language.   Data collected circa 2012-2013 in Laboratory for Neural Computation & Cognition at Brown.  Check the .xls sheet under code folder for more meta data, incl. OSpan etc.   - James F Cavanagh 02/15/2021
